  • Accelerometer: Extract jerk (derivative of acceleration) to detect sudden movements
  • Accelerometer: Apply FFT to extract frequency-domain features (dominant frequency, spectral energy)
  • Gyroscope (6 locations): Compute angular velocity magnitude
  • Gyroscope: Calculate rate of change for rotation detection
  • EMG (2 sensors): Compute RMS (Root Mean Square) for muscle activation
  • EMG: Extract envelope using moving average or Hilbert transform

MODEL_TRAINING:
  • Class imbalance detected (ratio 17.3:1) - Use weighted loss or SMOTE oversampling
  • Use sliding window segmentation (suggested: 128-256 samples per window with 50% overlap)
  • CNN-BiLSTM architecture: Conv1D(64) -> Conv1D(128) -> BiLSTM(64) -> Dense(1)
